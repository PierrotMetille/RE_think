## How to run the app

In android studio to run your app you'll need to select a configuration and a device.<br>

- Then on the left of the configuration select a device where to run the app. It can be on an emulated android device, on a web page or on android phone wired to your computer.  (Be sure to activate [developer mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) on the used phone.) 
- Now you can run your app on the selected device with the green play button. 

## Compile the project
