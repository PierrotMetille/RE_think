# RE_think

A Flutter project made by Garis Miehlbrat and Pierrot Métille.
The project is a chat app made to debate around a subject. The user will be able to create new cathegories or subject and new debate groups. Users can communicate with each others in private or public groups and with private messages.

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

- [Install Androide Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=fr&gclid=CjwKCAiAyfybBhBKEiwAgtB7fhbodCGzljOIOklC9Yvvlqf3bgdXQej5zjDeaaH-SlRKJ8yctW4mOBoC9psQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

## How to run the app

In android studio to run your app you'll need to select a configuration and a device.<br>
- In the upper right of android studio's interface switch configuration to "main.dart".<br>
- Then on the left of the configuration select a device where to run the app. It can be on an emulated android device, on a web page or on android phone wired to your computer.  (Be sure to activate [developer mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) on the used phone.) 
- Now you can run your app on the selected device with the green play button or with the command `flutter run`. 

## Compile the project

You can build the project with the following command : `flutter build apk`

## How to run test

Tests files are stored in the "re-think/test/" folder. To run the tests you'll need to change your configuration.<br>
- In the upper right of android studio's interface switch configuration from "main.dart" to "your_test_file.dart".<br>
- Then you can run the tests without selecting a device. Presse the "run" button to lunch the tests. 

## Code structure

A folder is created for each pages of the app and one for the main. Every folder have a view and a controller.

## Depot structure

For the moment, our structure is the documentation folder create in the androide project. The file and folder where created with the flutter project.
